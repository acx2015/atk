**Description**

Create a vertex induced subgraph obtained by vertex sampling.
Three types of vertex sampling are provided: 'uniform', 'degree', and
'degreedist'.
A 'uniform' vertex sample is obtained by sampling vertices uniformly at random.
For 'degree' vertex sampling, each vertex is weighted by its out-degree.
For 'degreedist' vertex sampling, each vertex is weighted by the total
number of vertices that have the same out-degree as it.
That is, the weight applied to each vertex for 'degreedist' vertex sampling
is given by the out-degree histogram bin size.
