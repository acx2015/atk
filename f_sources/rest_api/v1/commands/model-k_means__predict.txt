:name:

    model:k_means/predict

:arguments:


    **model** : unicode

    ..

        <Missing Description>



    **frame** : Frame

    ..

        A frame whose labels are to be predicted.
        By default, predict is run on the same columns over which the model is
        trained.



    **observation_columns** : list (default=None)

    ..

        Column(s) containing the observations whose clusters are to be predicted.
        By default, we predict the clusters over columns the KMeansModel was trained on.
        The columns are scaled using the same values used when training the model.

            The data returned is composed of multiple components:
        'k' columns : double
            Containing squared distance of each point to every cluster center.
        predicted_cluster : int
            Integer containing the cluster assignment.
