**Description**

Pulls graph from underlying store, calculates weighted degrees and writes them into the property
specified, and then writes the output graph to the underlying store.

**Degree Calculation**

A fundamental quantity in graph analyses is the degree of a vertex:
The degree of a vertex is the number of edges adjacent to it.

For a directed edge relation, a vertex has both an out-degree (the number of
edges leaving the vertex) and an in-degree (the number of edges entering the
vertex).

The toolkit provides a routine `annotate_degrees <annotate_degrees.html>`_
for calculating the degrees of vertices.
This calculation could be performed with a Gremlin query on smaller datasets
because Gremlin queries cannot be executed on a distributed scale.
The |PACKAGE| routine ``annotate_degrees`` can be executed at distributed scale.

In the presence of edge weights, vertices can have weighted degrees: The
weighted degree of a vertex is the sum of weights of edges adjacent to it.
Analogously, the weighted in-degree of a vertex is the sum of the weights of
the edges entering it, and the weighted out-degree is the sum
of the weights of the edges leaving the vertex.

The toolkit provides this routine for the distributed calculation of weighted
vertex degrees.
