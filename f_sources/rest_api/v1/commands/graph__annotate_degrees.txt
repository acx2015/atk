:name:

    graph/annotate_degrees

:arguments:


    **graph** : Graph

    ..

        <Missing Description>



    **output_property_name** : unicode

    ..

        The name of the new property.
        The degree is stored in this property.



    **degree_option** : unicode (default=None)

    ..

        Indicator for the definition of degree to be used for the
        calculation.
        Permitted values:

        *   "out" (default value) : Degree is calculated as the out-degree.
        *   "in" : Degree is calculated as the in-degree.
        *   "undirected" : Degree is calculated as the undirected degree.
            (Assumes that the edges are all undirected.)
           
        Any prefix of the strings "out", "in", "undirected" will select the
        corresponding option.



    **input_edge_labels** : list (default=None)

    ..

        If this list is provided, only edges whose labels are
        included in the given set will be considered in the degree calculation.
        In the default situation (when no list is provided), all edges will be used
        in the degree calculation, regardless of label.

**Description**

Creates a new graph which is the same as the input graph, with the addition
that every vertex of the graph has its :term:`degree` stored in a
user-specified property.

**Degree Calculation**

A fundamental quantity in graph analyses is the degree of a vertex:
The degree of a vertex is the number of edges adjacent to it.

For a directed edge relation, a vertex has both an out-degree (the number of
edges leaving the vertex) and an in-degree (the number of edges entering the
vertex).

The toolkit provides this routine for calculating the degrees of vertices.
This calculation could be performed with a Gremlin query on smaller datasets
because Gremlin queries cannot be executed on a distributed scale.
The |PACKAGE| routine ``annotate_degrees`` can be executed at distributed scale.

In the presence of edge weights, vertices can have weighted degrees: The
weighted degree of a vertex is the sum of weights of edges adjacent to it.
Analogously, the weighted in-degree of a vertex is the sum of the weights of
the edges entering it, and the weighted out-degree is the sum
of the weights of the edges leaving the vertex.

The toolkit provides `annotate_weighted_degrees <annotate_weighted_degrees.html>`_
for the distributed calculation of weighted vertex degrees.

``dict``

        Dictionary containing the vertex type as the key and the corresponding
        vertex's frame with a column storing the annotated degree for the vertex
        in a user specified property.
        Call dictionary_name['label'] to get the handle to frame whose vertex type
        is label.
