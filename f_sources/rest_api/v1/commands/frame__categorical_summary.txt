The returned value is a Map containing categorical summary for each specified column.

For each column, levels which satisfy the top k and/or threshold cutoffs are
displayed along with their frequency and percentage occurrence with respect to
the total rows in the dataset.

out levels which satisfy the threshold criterion.

Missing data is reported when a column value is empty ("") or null.

and percentage are reported as well.
