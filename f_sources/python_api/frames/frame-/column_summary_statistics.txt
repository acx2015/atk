.. function:: column_summary_statistics(self, data_column, weights_column=None, use_population_variance=None)

    Calculate multiple statistics for a column.


    :Parameters:

        **data_column** : unicode

        ..

            The column to be statistically summarized.
            Must contain numerical data; all NaNs and infinite values are excluded
            from the calculation.



        **weights_column** : unicode (default=None)

        ..

            Name of column holding weights of
            column values.



        **use_population_variance** : bool (default=None)

        ..

            If true, the variance is calculated
            as the population variance.
            If false, the variance calculated as the sample variance.
            Because this option affects the variance, it affects the standard
            deviation and the confidence intervals as well.
            Default is false.




    :Returns:

        : dict

        ..

            dict
                Dictionary containing summary statistics.
                The data returned is composed of multiple components:
            mean : [ double | None ]
                Arithmetic mean of the data.
            geometric_mean : [ double | None ]
                Geometric mean of the data.
                None when there is a data element <= 0, 1.0 when there are no
                data elements.
            variance : [ double | None ]
                None when there are <= 1 many data elements.
                Sample variance is the weighted sum of the squared distance of
                each data element from the weighted mean, divided by the total
                weight minus 1.
                None when the sum of the weights is <= 1.
                Population variance is the weighted sum of the squared distance
                of each data element from the weighted mean, divided by the total
                weight.
            standard_deviation : [ double | None ]
                The square root of the variance. None when  sample variance
                is being used and the sum of weights is <= 1.
            total_weight : long
                The count of all data elements that are finite numbers.
                (In other words, after excluding NaNs and infinite values.)
            minimum : [ double | None ]
                Minimum value in the data.
                None when there are no data elements.
            maximum : [ double | None ]
                Maximum value in the data. None when there are no data elements.
            mean_confidence_lower : [ double | None ]
                Lower limit of the 95% confidence interval about the mean.
                Assumes a Gaussian distribution.
                None when there are no elements of positive weight.
            mean_confidence_upper : [ double | None ]
                Upper limit of the 95% confidence interval about the mean.
                Assumes a Gaussian distribution.
                None when there are no elements of positive weight.
            bad_row_count : [ double | None ]
                The number of rows containing a NaN or infinite value
                in either the data or weights column.
            good_row_count : [ double | None ]
                The number of rows not containing a NaN or infinite
                value in either the data or weights column.
            positive_weight_count : [ double | None ]
                The number of valid data elements with weight > 0.
                This is the number of entries used in the statistical calculation.
            non_positive_weight_count : [ double | None ]
                The number valid data elements with finite weight <= 0.


    Notes
    -----
    Sample Variance
        Sample Variance is computed by the following formula:

        .. math::

            \left( \frac{1}{W - 1} \right) * sum_{i} \
            \left(x_{i} - M \right) ^{2}

        where :math:`W` is sum of weights over valid elements of positive
        weight, and :math:`M` is the weighted mean.

    Population Variance
        Population Variance is computed by the following formula:

        .. math::

            \left( \frac{1}{W} \right) * sum_{i} \
            \left(x_{i} - M \right) ^{2}

        where :math:`W` is sum of weights over valid elements of positive
        weight, and :math:`M` is the weighted mean.

    Standard Deviation
        The square root of the variance.

    Logging Invalid Data
        A row is bad when it contains a NaN or infinite value in either
        its data or weights column.
        In this case, it contributes to bad_row_count; otherwise it
        contributes to good row count.

        A good row can be skipped because the value in its weight
        column is less than or equal to 0.
        In this case, it contributes to non_positive_weight_count, otherwise
        (when the weight is greater than 0) it contributes to
        valid_data_weight_pair_count.

    Equations
        ``bad_row_count + good_row_count = # rows in the frame``

        ``positive_weight_count + non_positive_weight_count = good_row_count``

        In particular, when no weights column is provided and all weights
        are 1.0, ``non_positive_weight_count = 0`` and
        ``positive_weight_count = good_row_count``
