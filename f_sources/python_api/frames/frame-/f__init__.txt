:doc:`Frame <index>`  __init__
******************************

------


.. function:: __init__(self, source=None, name=None)

    Create a Frame/frame.


    :Parameters:

        **source** : CsvFile | Frame (default=None)

        ..

            A source of initial data.



        **name** : str (default=None)

        ..

            The name of the newly created frame.
            Default is None.


    Notes
    -----
    A frame with no name is subject to garbage collection.

    If a string in the CSV file starts and ends with a double-quote (")
    character, the character is stripped off of the data before it is put into
    the field.
    Anything, including delimiters, between the double-quote characters is
    considered part of the str.
    If the first character after the delimiter is anything other than a
    double-quote character, the string will be composed of all the characters
    between the delimiters, including double-quotes.
    If the first field type is str, leading spaces on each row are
    considered part of the str.
    If the last field type is str, trailing spaces on each row are
    considered part of the str.

    Examples
    --------
    Create a new frame based upon the data described in the CsvFile object
    *my_csv_schema*.
    Name the frame "myframe".
    Create a Frame *my_frame* to access the data:

    .. code::

        >>> my_frame = ta.Frame(my_csv_schema, "myframe")

    A Frame object has been created and *my_frame* is its proxy.
    It brought in the data described by *my_csv_schema*.
    It is named *myframe*.

    Create an empty frame; name it "yourframe":

    .. code::

        >>> your_frame = ta.Frame(name='yourframe')

    A frame has been created and Frame *your_frame* is its proxy.
    It has no data yet, but it does have the name *yourframe*.
