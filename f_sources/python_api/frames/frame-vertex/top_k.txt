.. function:: top_k(self, column_name, k, weights_column=None)

    Most or least frequent column values.


    :Parameters:

        **column_name** : unicode

        ..

            The column whose top (or bottom) K distinct values are
            to be calculated.



        **k** : int32

        ..

            Number of entries to return (If k is negative, return bottom k).



        **weights_column** : unicode (default=None)

        ..

            The column that provides weights (frequencies) for the topK calculation.
            Must contain numerical data.
            Default is 1 for all items.




    :Returns:

        : dict

        ..

            An object with access to the frame of data.
    Calculate the top (or bottom) K distinct values by count of a column.
    The column can be weighted.
    All data elements of weight <= 0 are excluded from the calculation, as are
    all data elements whose weight is NaN or infinite.
    If there are no data elements of finite weight > 0, then topK is empty.
