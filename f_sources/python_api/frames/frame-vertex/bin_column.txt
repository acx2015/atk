.. function:: bin_column(self, column_name, cutoffs, include_lowest=None, strict_binning=None, bin_column_name=None)

    Classify data into user-defined groups.


    :Parameters:

        **column_name** : unicode

        ..

            Name of the column to bin.



        **cutoffs** : list

        ..

            Array of values containing bin cutoff points.
            Array can be list or tuple.
            Array values must be progressively increasing.
            All bin boundaries must be included, so, with N bins, you need N+1 values.



        **include_lowest** : bool (default=None)

        ..

            Specify how the boundary conditions are handled.
            True indicates that the lower bound of the bin is inclusive.
            False indicates that the upper bound is inclusive.
            Default is True.



        **strict_binning** : bool (default=None)

        ..

            Specify how values outside of the cutoffs array should be binned.
            If set to True, each value less than cutoffs[0] or greater than
            cutoffs[-1] will be assigned a bin value of -1.
            If set to False, values less than cutoffs[0] will be included in the first
            bin while values greater than cutoffs[-1] will be included in the final
            bin.



        **bin_column_name** : unicode (default=None)

        ..

            The name for the new binned column.
            Default is ``<column_name>_binned``.




    :Returns:

        : dict

        ..


    Summarize rows of data based on the value in a single column by sorting them
    into bins, or groups, based on a list of bin cutoff points.

    Notes
    -----
    1)  Unicode in column names is not supported and will likely cause the
        drop_frames() method (and others) to fail!
    2)  Bins IDs are 0-index: the lowest bin number is 0.
    3)  The first and last cutoffs are always included in the bins.
        When include_lowest is ``True``, the last bin includes both cutoffs.
        When include_lowest is ``False``, the first bin (bin 0) includes both
        cutoffs.
