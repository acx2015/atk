.. function:: entropy(self, data_column, weights_column=None)

    Calculate the Shannon entropy of a column.


    :Parameters:

        **data_column** : unicode

        ..

            The column whose entropy is to be calculated.



        **weights_column** : unicode (default=None)

        ..

            The column that provides weights (frequencies) for the entropy calculation.
            Must contain numerical data.
            Default is using uniform weights of 1 for all items.




    :Returns:

        : dict

        ..

            Entropy.
    The data column is weighted via the weights column.
    All data elements of weight <= 0 are excluded from the calculation, as are
    all data elements whose weight is NaN or infinite.
    If there are no data elements with a finite weight greater than 0,
    the entropy is zero.
