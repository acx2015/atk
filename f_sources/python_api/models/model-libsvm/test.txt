.. function:: test(self, frame, label_column, observation_columns=None)

    |ALPHA|
    Predict test frame labels and return metrics.


    :Parameters:

        **frame** : Frame

        ..

            A frame whose labels are to be predicted.



        **label_column** : unicode

        ..

            Column containing the actual label for each
            observation.



        **observation_columns** : list (default=None)

        ..

            Column(s) containing the observations whose
            labels are to be predicted and tested.
            Default is to test over the columns the LibsvmModel
            was trained on.




    :Returns:

        : dict

        ..

            Object
                Object with binary classification metrics.
                The data returned is composed of multiple components:
            <object>.accuracy : double
                 The degree of correctness of the test frame labels.
            <object>.confusion_matrix : table
                A specific table layout that allows visualization of the performance of the
                test.
            <object>.f_measure : double
                A measure of a test's accuracy.
                It considers both the precision and the recall of the test to compute
                the score.
            <object>.precision : double
                The degree to which the correctness of the label is expressed.
            <object>.recall : double
                 The fraction of relevant instances that are retrieved.
    Predict the labels for a test frame and run classification
    metrics on predicted and target labels.
