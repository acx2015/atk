    |BETA|
    Creates Latent Dirichlet Allocation model


    :Parameters:

        **frame** : Frame

        ..

            Input frame data.



        **document_column_name** : unicode

        ..

            Column Name for documents.
            Column should contain a str value.



        **word_column_name** : unicode

        ..

            Column name for words.
            Column should contain a str value.



        **word_count_column_name** : unicode

        ..

            Column name for word count.
            Column should contain an int64 value.



        **max_iterations** : int32 (default=None)

        ..

            The maximum number of iterations that the algorithm will execute.
            The valid value range is all positive int.
            Default is 20.



        **alpha** : float32 (default=None)

        ..

            The hyper-parameter for document-specific distribution over topics.
            Mainly used as a smoothing parameter in :term:`Bayesian inference`.
            Larger value implies that documents are assumed to cover all topics
            more uniformly; smaller value implies that documents are more
            concentrated on a small subset of topics.
            Valid value range is all positive float.
             Default is 0.1.



        **beta** : float32 (default=None)

        ..

            The hyper-parameter for word-specific distribution over topics.
            Mainly used as a smoothing parameter in :term:`Bayesian inference`.
            Larger value implies that topics contain all words more uniformly and
            smaller value implies that topics are more concentrated on a small
            subset of words.
            Valid value range is all positive float.
            Default is 0.1.



        **convergence_threshold** : float32 (default=None)

        ..

            The amount of change in LDA model parameters that will be tolerated
            at convergence.
            If the change is less than this threshold, the algorithm exits
            before it reaches the maximum number of supersteps.
            Valid value range is all positive float and 0.0.
            Default is 0.001.



        **evaluate_cost** : bool (default=None)

        ..

            "True" means turn on cost evaluation and "False" means turn off
            cost evaluation.
            It's relatively expensive for LDA to evaluate cost function.
            For time-critical applications, this option allows user to turn off cost
            function evaluation.
            Default is "False".



        **num_topics** : int32 (default=None)

        ..

            The number of topics to identify in the LDA model.
            Using fewer topics will speed up the computation, but the extracted topics
            might be more abstract or less specific; using more topics will
            result in more computation but lead to more specific topics.
            Valid value range is all positive int.
            Default is 10.




    :Returns:

        : dict

        ..

                Frame with LDA results.
            word_results : Frame
                Frame with LDA results.
            report : str
               The configuration and learning curve report for Latent Dirichlet
               Allocation as a multiple line str.
