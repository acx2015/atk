.. function:: predict(self, frame, observation_columns=None)

    |BETA|
    Predict the cluster assignments for the data points.


    :Parameters:

        **frame** : Frame

        ..

            A frame whose labels are to be predicted.
            By default, predict is run on the same columns over which the model is
            trained.



        **observation_columns** : list (default=None)

        ..

            Column(s) containing the observations whose clusters are to be predicted.
            By default, we predict the clusters over columns the KMeansModel was trained on.
            The columns are scaled using the same values used when training the model.




    :Returns:

        : dict

        ..

            Frame
                A new frame consisting of the existing columns of the frame and new columns.
                The data returned is composed of multiple components:
            'k' columns : double
                Containing squared distance of each point to every cluster center.
            predicted_cluster : int
                Integer containing the cluster assignment.
