.. function:: graphx_triangle_count(self, output_property, input_edge_labels=None)

    Number of triangles among vertices of current graph.


    :Parameters:

        **output_property** : unicode

        ..

            The name of output property to be
            added to vertex/edge upon completion.



        **input_edge_labels** : list (default=None)

        ..

            The name of edge labels to be considered for triangle count.
            Default is all edges are considered.




    :Returns:

        : dict

        ..

            dict(label, Frame).
            Dictionary containing the vertex type as the key and the corresponding
            vertex's frame with a triangle_count column.
            Call dictionary_name['label'] to get the handle to frame whose vertex
            type is label.
    ** Experimental Feature **
    Triangle Count.
    Counts the number of triangles among vertices in an undirected graph.
    If an edge is marked bidirectional, the implementation opts for canonical
    orientation of edges hence counting it only once (similar to an
    undirected graph).
