    Pulls graph from underlying store, calculates weighted degrees and writes them into the property
    specified, and then writes the output graph to the underlying store.

    **Degree Calculation**

    A fundamental quantity in graph analyses is the degree of a vertex:
    The degree of a vertex is the number of edges adjacent to it.

    For a directed edge relation, a vertex has both an out-degree (the number of
    edges leaving the vertex) and an in-degree (the number of edges entering the
    vertex).

    The toolkit provides a routine `annotate_degrees <annotate_degrees.html>`_
    for calculating the degrees of vertices.
    This calculation could be performed with a Gremlin query on smaller datasets
    because Gremlin queries cannot be executed on a distributed scale.
    The |PACKAGE| routine ``annotate_degrees`` can be executed at distributed scale.

    In the presence of edge weights, vertices can have weighted degrees: The
    weighted degree of a vertex is the sum of weights of edges adjacent to it.
    Analogously, the weighted in-degree of a vertex is the sum of the weights of
    the edges entering it, and the weighted out-degree is the sum
    of the weights of the edges leaving the vertex.

    The toolkit provides this routine for the distributed calculation of weighted
    vertex degrees.
