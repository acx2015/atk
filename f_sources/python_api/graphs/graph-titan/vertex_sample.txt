.. function:: vertex_sample(self, size, sample_type, seed=None)

    Make subgraph from vertex sampling.


    :Parameters:

        **size** : int32

        ..

            The number of vertices to sample from the graph.



        **sample_type** : unicode

        ..

            The type of vertex sample among: ['uniform', 'degree', 'degreedist'].



        **seed** : int64 (default=None)

        ..

            Random seed value.




    :Returns:

            A new Graph object representing the vertex induced subgraph.
    Create a vertex induced subgraph obtained by vertex sampling.
    Three types of vertex sampling are provided: 'uniform', 'degree', and
    'degreedist'.
    A 'uniform' vertex sample is obtained by sampling vertices uniformly at random.
    For 'degree' vertex sampling, each vertex is weighted by its out-degree.
    For 'degreedist' vertex sampling, each vertex is weighted by the total
    number of vertices that have the same out-degree as it.
    That is, the weight applied to each vertex for 'degreedist' vertex sampling
    is given by the out-degree histogram bin size.
